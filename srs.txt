Software Requirements Specification (SRS) Report

    Introduction
    1.1 Purpose
    The purpose of this Software Requirements Specification (SRS) report is to provide a comprehensive and detailed overview of the requirements for the Data Science Project, spe

    cifically focusing on Twitter Sentiment Analysis using VADER for Political Campaigns. This SRS report follows the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) standard format for software requirements documentation.

1.2 Scope
The Data Science Project aims to develop a data-driven solution that leverages advanced analytics and machine learning techniques to extract valuable insights from large datasets of tweets related to political campaigns. The solution will perform sentiment analysis on the collected tweets using the VADER sentiment analysis tool and develop a machine learning model for sentiment classification. The project will also include a recommendation engine to provide meaningful insights and recommendations for optimizing political campaign strategies.

    Project Overview
    2.1 Data Collection
    The system will collect a large dataset of tweets related to political campaigns using Twitter API or other data scraping methods. The collected tweets will be stored in a structured format for further processing.

2.2 Sentiment Analysis
The system will perform sentiment analysis on the collected tweets using the VADER sentiment analysis tool. The sentiment polarity (positive, negative, or neutral) of each tweet will be classified, and an overall sentiment intensity compound score will be generated.

2.3 Machine Learning Model
The system will develop a machine learning model using Python programming language and appropriate machine learning libraries such as Scikit-Learn. The model will be trained on a labeled dataset of tweets with sentiment polarity as the target variable, using algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or Support Vector Machines. The best-performing model will be selected for sentiment classification of real-time tweets.

2.4 Recommendation Engine
The system will generate meaningful recommendations based on the sentiment analysis results. The recommendations will provide insights on the performance of political campaigns, identifying strengths and weaknesses of campaign strategies. The recommendations will be presented in a clear and understandable format, such as reports or visualizations.
